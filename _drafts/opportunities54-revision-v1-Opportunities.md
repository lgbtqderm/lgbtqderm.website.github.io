      <em>Recruiting mentors (!) and mentees</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.glderm.org/mentorship.php" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.glderm.org/mentorship.php">Gay and Lesbian Dermatology Association (GALDA) Mentorship program </a>seeks to connect <strong>residents and early career dermatologists</strong> with <strong>experienced board-certified dermatologists</strong> to provide advanced clinical training, promotion of leadership skills, and/or encouragement of research endeavors. The program will provide <strong>up to $1500 to the mentee</strong> to reimburse housing and travel expenses associated with the mentorship experience. Mentorships are typically <strong>1-2 weeks</strong> in duration.<br /><br />After a mentee applies and the proposal is approved by the GALDA mentorship committee, the requested mentor will be contacted to consider and approve the request. After approval, the mentor will be connected with the mentee to coordinate dates and other details. The mentor should be willing to provide a meaningful and educational experience for the mentee. The mentee will submit a summary of the experience after completion for inclusion in our newsletter.
